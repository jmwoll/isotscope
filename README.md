# isotscope

Isotscope is a simple prototype of a IUPAC chemical Nomenclature
and SMILES aware isotopic pattern calculator.
It is build upon the wonderful OPSIN (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature) library (see http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/ and J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2011, 51 (3), pp 739–753).

Sum formulas, IUPAC names and SMILES can be combined to calculate isotopic
patterns:

## Installation

The .jar files with and without dependencies can be found under /jars.

## Usage

Assuming java is installed on your system, just run the standalone .jar file
from the command line:

    $ java -jar isotscope-0.1.3-standalone.jar


which opens the application in a new window.
